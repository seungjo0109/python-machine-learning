## Vectors and Vector Arithmetic
* Vectors are a foundational element of linear algebra. Vectors are used throughout the filed of machine learning in the description of algorithms and processed such as the target variable ($y$) when training an algorithm.

### 1. What is a Vector
* A Vector is a tuple of one or more values called scalars.
* Vectors are often represented using a lowercase character such as $v$; for example:
<br>$v = (v_1, v_2, v_3)$

* Where $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are scalar values, often real values.
* Vectors are also shown using a vertical representaion or a column.
* It is common to represent the target variable as a vector with the lowercase $y$ when describing the training of a machine learning algorithm.
* It is commonm to introduce vectors using a geometric analogy, where a vector represents a point or coordinate in an n-dimensional space, where $n$ is the number of dimensions.
* The vector can also be thought of as a line from the origin of the vector space with a direction and a magnitude.

### 2. Defining a Vector
* We can represent a vector in Python as a NumPy array.
* A NumPy array can be created from a list of numbers.
