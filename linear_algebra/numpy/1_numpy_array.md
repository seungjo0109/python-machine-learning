## Introduction to Numpy Arrays
* Arrays are the main data structure used in machine learning. In python, arrays from the NumPy library, called N-dimensional arrays of the __ndarray__, are used as the primary data structure for representing data.

### 1. NumPy N-dimensional Array
* Numpy is a Python library that can be used for scientific and numerical applications and is the tool to use for linear algebra operations.
* The main data structure in NumPy is the ndarray, which is a shorthand name for N-dimensional array.
* When working with NumPy, data in an __ndarray__ is simply referred to as an array. It is a fixed-sized array in memory that contains data of the same tpye, such as integers or floating point values.
